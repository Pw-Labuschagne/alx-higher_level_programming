As one continue one's journey in python you will get stuck, hopefully the network isin't one of them.

The tasks are:

#0.Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response
#1.Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
#2.Write a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response
#3.Write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.
#4.Write a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
#5.Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response
#6.Technical interview preparation:

    You are not allowed to google anything
    Whiteboard first

Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

    Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
    You are not allowed to import any module
    Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
    6-peak.py must contain the function
    6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
    Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
