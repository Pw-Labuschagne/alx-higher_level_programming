"""Technical interview preparation:

    You are not allowed to google anything
    Whiteboard first

Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

    Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
    You are not allowed to import any module
    Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
    6-peak.py must contain the function
    6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
    Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
